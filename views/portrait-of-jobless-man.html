<p>used pictures at a later stage. first the background was green, didn't
    like it. then got tip from teacher martijn that it reminder him of picasso's blue
    period, maybe i could add that atmosphere in it. like the blue much better because it
    represents sadness. the sadness is overwhelming him. i could have gone into more detail,
    but forced myself not to, using quite broad strokes.</p>
