                        <p>my first oil painting portrait. using a grid and kohl to draw on the canvas first. then set up the painting using only grayscale, to make sure contrast and tones were right. then add the layer with color. took ages. i completely screwed up one eye, it was too high, it was soggy, dark, jagged. this was a nightmare! i painted over it with light colors, let it dry, and repainted the eye. i learned to work with colors, to go easy with dark colors, that a mistake is fine, you can correct it. that parts can take a long time but can be rewarding, such as hands. from an article in de volkskrant about personality <a target="_blank" href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/wetenschap/of-je-je-karakter-kunt-veranderen-nou-in-elk-geval-een-beetje~b11234e6/">'of je je karakter kunt veranderen? nou, in elk geval een beetje' by margreet vermeulen</a>. picture from eric smits.</p>

                        <p>just a quick sketch from a remote lesson from andrea during covid. there was a timer set for only a few minutes to sketch still lives. working with light and dark. working fast. learning to look at objects differently, for example by 'blind' sketching.</p>

                        <p>painted this at home. wanted to paint a portrait, but not spend too much time on it. didn't have to be super realistic. first time drawing from a real model - it was easier than i thought. used pictures at a later stage. first the background was green, didn't like it. then got tip from teacher martijn that it reminder him of picasso's blue period, maybe i could add that atmosphere in it. like the blue much better because it represents sadness. the sadness is overwhelming him. i could have gone into more detail, but forced myself not to, using quite broad strokes.</p>

                        <p>remote workshop from vera about painting clouds. based upon painting from willem tholen. learned that cloud should 'look' as if it's further than the sea, tried to fix it. learned that you should build it up in big parts. cloud is reflected in sea. white is usually too white, better mix a bit of oker or something in it. by making the background darker, the cloud got more in forefront.
