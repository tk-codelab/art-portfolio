To start compiling scss into css, use the command 'npm run scss' from the root of the project folder.

# TO DO / FIX

- cross browser
- accessibility

# Technology

## Node

Node.js server https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction

## Express
Minimalist web framework for node

## EJS

EJS templating engine. https://ejs.co/

## HTML, CSS, JS

Basic html, basic scss compiled to css with node-sass https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/watch-and-compile-sass-in-five-quick-steps--cms-28275. 

Using css grid, css animations.

I believe in simplicity, minimalism. Work from necessity - only add things when you need them.

## NO CMS

Decided not to use a CMS. Website will load faster without. CMS is often clogged, overpowered.
